This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to include a necessary file (requirements.txt in this case).  The initial Dockerfile attempts to install Python packages using pip, but the `requirements.txt` file is missing, leading to a build failure. The solution shows the correct way to include the file and build the image successfully.  The `app.py` file is a placeholder and doesn't contain any significant functionality.
